# Face-Emotion-Recognition

To recognize facial expression from candid, non-posed images, I have proposed a deep-learning based approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In order to evaluate the performance in real-time candid facial expression recognition, I have extracted a candid image facial expression, with seven types of expression in more than 5000 images gathered from the Web-source.

The structure of our proposed CNN-based approach is described, and a data augmentation technique is provided in order to generate sufficient number of training samples. The performance using the feature-based approaches is close to the state of the art when tested with standard datasets, but fails to function well when dealing with candid images. The experimentation shows that the CNN-based approach is very effective in candid image expression recognition, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches, by a 82% Validation Accuracy & 100% Training Accuracy.
